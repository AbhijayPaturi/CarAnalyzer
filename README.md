# CarAnalyzer
App that Allows a User to Analyze a Car Dataset through Parallel Computations. Leveraging Apache Hadoop and Spark to execute upon parallel computing.

## Description

There are four major components to this project: data partitioning, map functions, reduce functions, and UI/UX for the search and analytics functions.<br>

I've included a PDF detailing the project design, the high- and low-level design implementation, and my learning experiences. Please give it a read and offer any feedback on the design or the map/reduce/partitioning functions.
